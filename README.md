# Spam Email Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is a **Spam Email Classification System** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. It processes textual email data, applies feature extraction, and trains a model to achieve accurate email classification.

## üöÄ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**  
  - Removes unnecessary characters, punctuation, and duplication.

- **Feature Extraction**  
  - Uses TF-IDF Vectorization or Bag of Words for numerical representation of text.

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Employs classification models like Naive Bayes for spam detection.

- **Real-Time Prediction**  
  - Allows users to input email content and predict if it is spam or not.
